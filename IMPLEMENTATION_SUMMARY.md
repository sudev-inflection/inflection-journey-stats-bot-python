# Implementation Summary: Automatic Retry Mechanism for 401 Errors

## Problem Solved

The original issue was that when MCP tool calls encountered 401 Unauthorized errors from the Inflection.io API, the errors were being returned directly to the client, causing a poor user experience.

## Solution Implemented

### 1. Core Retry Mechanism (`_make_authenticated_request`)

Added a new method in `InflectionAPIClient` that:
- **Detects 401 errors** automatically
- **Clears authentication state** when 401 is encountered
- **Automatically re-authenticates** using environment variables
- **Retries the original request** with new authentication
- **Provides detailed logging** for debugging
- **Handles multiple retry attempts** (max 2 retries = 3 total attempts)

### 2. Updated API Methods

Modified all API methods to use the retry mechanism:
- `get_journeys()` - Now uses `_make_authenticated_request`
- `get_email_reports()` - Now uses `_make_authenticated_request` for all endpoint calls
- All individual endpoint calls within email reports

### 3. Enhanced Error Handling

Updated tool handlers to provide user-friendly error messages:
- **401 Errors**: "Authentication failed. Please try using the 'inflection_login' tool again with your credentials."
- **Re-authentication Failed**: "Unable to automatically re-authenticate. Please use the 'inflection_login' tool again with your credentials."
- **Max Retries**: "Request failed after multiple attempts. Please try again or use the 'inflection_login' tool to refresh your authentication."

### 4. Comprehensive Logging

Added structured logging throughout the retry process:
- **Warning logs** when 401 errors are detected
- **Info logs** when re-authentication starts and completes
- **Error logs** when re-authentication fails
- **Success logs** when requests succeed after retries

## Key Features

### ✅ Automatic Recovery
- No manual intervention required
- Seamless user experience
- Transparent to end users

### ✅ Robust Error Handling
- Graceful degradation
- User-friendly error messages
- No exposure of technical details

### ✅ Security
- Sensitive information never logged
- Secure token management
- Proper authentication state clearing

### ✅ Comprehensive Testing
- Test script validates retry mechanism
- Simulates token expiration scenarios
- Verifies automatic re-authentication

## Files Modified

1. **`src/server_new.py`**
   - Added `_make_authenticated_request()` method
   - Updated `get_journeys()` and `get_email_reports()` methods
   - Enhanced error handling in tool handlers
   - Improved logging throughout

2. **`test_retry_mechanism.py`** (New)
   - Comprehensive test suite for retry mechanism
   - Tests authentication, normal calls, and re-authentication
   - Validates token refresh functionality

3. **`RETRY_MECHANISM.md`** (New)
   - Complete documentation of the retry mechanism
   - Implementation details and configuration options
   - Troubleshooting guide

4. **`IMPLEMENTATION_SUMMARY.md`** (This file)
   - Summary of changes and solution overview

## Testing Results

✅ **All tests passed successfully:**
- Initial authentication works
- Normal API calls function correctly
- Automatic re-authentication after token expiration works
- Token refresh is successful
- Server imports and initializes properly

## Benefits

1. **Improved User Experience**: No more 401 errors exposed to clients
2. **Automatic Recovery**: System handles token expiration automatically
3. **Better Reliability**: Robust error handling and retry logic
4. **Enhanced Debugging**: Comprehensive logging for troubleshooting
5. **Security**: Sensitive authentication details are protected

## Usage

The retry mechanism is now active by default for all MCP tool calls. Users will experience:

- **Seamless operation** even when tokens expire
- **Automatic recovery** from authentication issues
- **Clear error messages** when manual intervention is needed
- **No technical error details** exposed in user-facing messages

The implementation follows the repository's coding standards and integrates seamlessly with the existing MCP server architecture.
